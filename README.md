### Data

We share Twitter Weather and NYC Cab datasets in [DyGED_data.zip](DyGED_data.zip). Hedge Fund data unfortunately cannot be publicized.
We also provide [data_utils.py](source/data_utils.py) which process the graphs into PyTorch Geometric format.
Please contact us if any issue encountered.

### Implementation

We share our framework in [models.py](source/models.py), but it does not support PyTorch geometric, but raw data. We hope to implement PyTorch Geometric version soon.
